Simple Pong game written in C++/SDL. Should compile under Linux with minimal changes.

Control Player 1 (left paddle) with W and S. Control Player 2 (right paddle) with Up and Down arrows.

You can make either player a (dumb) bot by setting the isCpu flag in their constructors to true.

The game was made for 800x600, but can be changed easily to run under different resolutions, though 
paddle and ball speeds should be adjusted accordingly.

You need to SDL and SDL_ttf libraries to run this game.
